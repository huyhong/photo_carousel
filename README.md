[mock]: https://github.com/huyhong/photo_carousel/raw/master/photo_carousel_mock.png

### Instructions:
* Write this as a prototype with the intent of turning this into a proper component
* Code it the way you prefer, use libraries and techniques you're comfortable with
* Look up resources/docs as needed
* Do as much as you can in the time alloted, we don't expect you to complete all the specs
* Plan your time to work towards your strengths, it's okay to leave things sparse as long as it's commented as such

### Specs:
* Left and right arrows to scroll through photos, should loop/cycle
* Photo should display 100% width of the container
* Container should grow vertically to accomodate the photo's aspect ratio
* Basic fade-in/out animations
* Photo sources:
