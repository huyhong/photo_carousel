# Build a photo carousel

### Instructions:
* Write this as a prototype with the intent of turning this into a proper component in the future
* Do as much as you can in the time alloted, we don't expect you to complete all the specs
* Plan your time to work towards your strengths, it's okay to leave things sparse as long as it's commented as such

### Specs:
* Left and right arrows to scroll through photos, should loop/cycle
* Photo should display 100% width of the container
* Container should grow vertically to accomodate the photo's aspect ratio
* Basic fade-in/out animations
* Photo sources:
  * Static array of URLs: `['https://cdn.glitch.com/a606b2ac-adf4-4165-9f7a-6f7d2e3f1b4e%2FIMG_6580.jpg?1532627591767', 'https://cdn.glitch.com/a606b2ac-adf4-4165-9f7a-6f7d2e3f1b4e%2FDSC07233.jpg?1532627592128', 'https://cdn.glitch.com/a606b2ac-adf4-4165-9f7a-6f7d2e3f1b4e%2FIMG_5948.jpg?1532627592065', 'https://cdn.glitch.com/a606b2ac-adf4-4165-9f7a-6f7d2e3f1b4e%2FDSC06923.jpg?1532627592271', 'https://cdn.glitch.com/a606b2ac-adf4-4165-9f7a-6f7d2e3f1b4e%2FDSC06790.jpg?1532627592194']`
